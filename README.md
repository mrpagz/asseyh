# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

I have created a coding quiz composed of 5 simple questions from the topics we covered. The user needs to answer the 5 question within 25 seconds and gets a point for correct answers and incorrect answers will take away 3 seconds of the time.The quiz will end if the time reaches zero and if all questions has been answered. User is prompted to put initials and can view highscores.
